Setup: It specifies the license and the version of Solidity used. Token details: It defines the token's name ("METACRAFT") and abbreviation ("MTAC"). Total supply: It tracks the total number of tokens currently in circulation (initially 0). Balances: It keeps a record of how many tokens each account holds (using an address as the key). Minting: It allows creating new tokens (adding them to the total supply) and assigning them to an address. Burning: It allows destroying existing tokens (reducing the total supply) from a specific address's balance. Overall, this code acts like a basic token with functions to control its creation and destruction.
