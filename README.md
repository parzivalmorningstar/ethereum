This Solidity smart contract titled `MyToken` is a simple example of a custom token that is based on the ERC20 standard. It defines three public variables: The current variables used are `tokenName`, `tokenAbbrv`, and `totalSupply` to store the name of the token which is “METACRAFT”, the abbreviation of the token which is “MTAC” and the total supply of the tokens respectively. Furthermore, there is a mapping named `balances` that will help to store the token balances by addresses. The contract provides two main functions: Their usage is expressed by the verbs `mint` and `burn`. The `mint` function makes it possible for new tokens to be created by adding the `totalSupply` and the balance of the address that is called with a particular value. On the other hand, the `burn` function allows the elimination of tokens by decreasing the `totalSupply` and the balance of a specific address provided that the address has enough credit. This contract helps to control the token supply and every user balance and allow to mint and burn tokens.
