**My Token Smart Contract**

This Solidity program declares a simple token contract called MyToken. It introduces the basic ideas of token generation, issuance, and destruction, so it is suitable for those who are just starting with Solidity and blockchain.
**Description** 

The MyToken is a basic implementation of token smart contract on Ethereum using the Solidity language. The contract has the capability to create new tokens and destroy existing tokens and also to keep records of balances of token holder. It is useful to look at this example to better understand how tokens are handled within a smart contract.

**Executing the Program**

To implement this program, one can use Remix, an online IDE for Solidity. Follow these steps to get started:Follow these steps to get started:

Navigate to the Remix website: Remix IDE.

In the list of options on the left of the screen, click the "+" icon to make a new file. Save the file with a ‘.’ sol extension, for example, MyToken. sol.

To gather the code, navigate to the “Solidity Compiler” in the list on the left side of the interface. Make sure the “Compiler” is set at “0. 8. 18” or another appropriate version, then click the “Compile MyToken. sol” button.

Once compiled, deploy it by going to the “Deploy & Run Transactions” tab located in the left side bar. From the dropdown menu, select the “MyToken” contract and hit on the “Deploy” button.

Once deployed, you can interact with the contract by calling the mint and burn functions:Once deployed, you can interact with the contract by calling the mint and burn functions:

To create a new token, in the mint section, input the address and the quantity of tokens needed and then click on transact.

In the burn function, enter the address and the amount of tokens and in the field “Transact” click.
